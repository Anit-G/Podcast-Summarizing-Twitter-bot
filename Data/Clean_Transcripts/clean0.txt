Because karma's good Like if you helped Carol get put on and she gets a $60000 raise and gets to move back to San Francisco where her family is that is just putting good into the world This portion is like with me so I think this is when you need to get selfish Like you need to ask your question Hiring is guessing firing is knowing Like you got to go fast That is how you get shit done that is how you figure stuff out This is the television and the television is the radio So 4Ds motherfuckers So this is the time where I think you just kind of go really selfish and ask your direct question So I will start So we are in the training manual space documentation SOPs Yep And the biggest problem we have is messaging and how to make it urgent because small businesses want to do anything but sit down and just write out all their processes And I feel like a chameleon with an elevator pitch in trying to describe what we do So I am curious on how you would hone in on a message around why a business needs a playbook or how do you create urgency Um so it might not be urgency so let us start with that but one more time because I want to really understand You are telling an SMB that they should sit down and create a manual Or crowd source it with all their people so that all their policies processes are in one place and they are training their new hires the same way And as they grow everyone is doing things And you want all that information to sit on your platform Yeah As a SaaS business Yes Understood So we have got about 1500 I do not think you should It is not about urgency I think it is about money I think the way you will get SMBs to really come in if you are message is One of the biggest reasons I am really good at SMB marketing is because my dad is like the cliche textbook central casting of like an SMB Everything's defense Everything's like short term ROI They are not getting tricked into lower funnel it is just lower funnel is what they do SMBs do not build brand they are in the sales business Everything is short term It is the nature of the beast So I love these questions because it is so easy for me to go into my head and be like what would get my dad to do this He would never sit down and do it on theory He would definitely not do it because it was good for his employees He would not It is just not what he is He would definitely do it if I could convince him that he is wasting $8340 a year because that is how many hours are being wasted on managers training people that they could be doing in selling You need to turn this into a financial thing You make one fuckin' smart video that shows like humans equal money and they waste time because they are telling Rick what to Like you just paint them the scenario Like you walk into a liquor store let us use that one and you go "Hey do your managers train your new "How do your new people come out" Well they just fuckin' we throw them into the wild Do they make mistakes and wrong stickers are put on things and you lose money Yep And do sometimes your manager have to ring up people at the register because they did not know what to do at the register mhmm Like do you understand how much that is actually worth if you take your average manager who makes 65000 a year and you take 89 hours a month You have to make this binary math It is an ROI thing ROI thing How much does your product cost It starts at 99 a month Perfect You need to basically convince all of them that they are wasting 200 bucks a month and that you are going to give them back 100 bucks It will kill Money in the bank I do not know if I have been more confident of a piece of advice in 4Ds since we started it I am not kidding I am not kidding I am that confident SMBs are binarily on short term economics If you tell them you pay me 100 bucks what they are very bad at is hidden costs Small businesses are bad at hidden costs They are too binary They do not see the bigger picture and this is obviously generalizing but it is very cliche Especially when you come from zero Cash is king you are looking at it And you are not saying like you know Okay A straight ROI conversation Yep They just do not want to give you 100 bucks a month for something that is not going to be used You got to convince them that they are wasting 400 bucks a month on hidden fees on hidden costs that your thing solves for Yeah okay Like literally every one of them is training through osmosis which is taking time out of experienced workers to just teach the new kid what to do instead of the new kid spending a week fuckin' Do you understand Yeah totally Okay The other thing we are dealing with is I have done a lot of the content as just kind of a personal brand and we hired a content manager we hired a video producer but we are kind of unsure on what to create content around Is it the business or is it me and how do we divide that You need to build the content around common day problems of SMBs Through our company channel Both will work Those are both I am agnostic to that If you started an entire series of did you know for SMBs you need to watch it I need them to So just any kind of content The reason for all of us to do content is to have somebody watch it to then create an opportunity Whatever that may be I am secretly trying to crowdsource buying the New York Jets You may want to get more people on your SaaS product So I think that the place where people spend a lot of time on is the equipment the lighting the debate of personal brand versus logo and what the only thing that matters is make shit that people want to watch that you want to talk to Right that makes a lot of sense for you It is what you did It is why it may seem unique when you tell it for them the audience but I so understand it because when you scratch your own itch and your itch is your community it is just perpetual It is how you stumble into your thing You were doing this and like And so your job is to make the best content in the world for small businesses Right You know like how to hire your family member And it is broad like talk about documentation and Definitely not about documentation That is the curve ball got it Documentation is selfish Making a video where you interview somebody who teaches people how to fire relatives is thinking about small businesses Right That is what small businesses That is one of the biggest issues every SMB has in the world right now How do I fire my loser cousin My fucked up aunt You know How do I limit my grandfather's yelling at me Like it is human stuff You become that It is what I always talk about Be the media company Do not make content that is literal to you One of the challenges we were talking to Ross about a little bit was just the What has allowed us to scale this far is just direct response ads on Facebook and Instagram Makes sense And so we have gotten really good at identifying the pain the solution here is the product That is good But we have not put too much into the building the brand equity around the content like what you are talking about And that is what you want to do because it is going to get you a cack in your LTB numbers in a much better place over time especially when all the What happens next to this whole Gary V era where a lot of people have won off of the thesis is enough money comes in where the ads do not work anymore That is what happens next Let me tell you what 2022's going to be about Everybody that plays That is why I am glad you are here Because you are going to go you are going to take advantage of the pay It is why I am glad you are here you are taking advantage of the pay and you need to build brand You guys are on the opposite spectrum And if you do not have both you become vulnerable Vulnerable You do not get the max upside You can be more like you know I think a lot about like how I I have been thinking a lot about how I talk like vulnerable is not you go out of business vulnerable is like you do not keep growing and when you do not keep growing things could happen Maybe you are spending too much in your lifestyle based on how your business is and all of a sudden it stops growing then you actually become vulnerable Those are the things I think about But yeah you have to build brand I am curious in scaling so fast in your business how did you make sure the knowledge transfer happens Osmosis Yeah so like I am not as comf Like my whole company wants to use your product except for me because I am an entrepreneur and I am SMB That is why I know what you need to do I am real tricky for you because I do not care about money either But most do So it is okay that I am all the way over here I am not going to be the guy but like for the SMB that does not want to do it in the proper way and wants osmosis she or he will take you up on I will save you $4000 here is how And by the way we wasted enormous time on senior people training people through osmosis And where we started evolving into more products like you is I started realizing wait a minute not everybody learns like me So I got Ds and Fs And so maybe we do need stuff like this in place Do you think that Have you seen B2B SaaS products leverage influencers and celebrities and that sort of thing as an effective thing They will They will Sure Is there some Of course Go Daddy ran several commercials Right You know of course Mail Chimp Like a lot of these less expensive like your products Like with our marketing when we really started to take off it was like the ads we were running were just the two of us walking and talking on the street Keep doing that And we got a point where like we tripled our team and felt like we should be producing higher more production and It did not carry as well Yeah it did not go as well Just keep it raw Keep it valuable It is not about raw it is about valuable Star Wars is valuable I go into a theater I escape from my real life for three hours like it is escapism You guys doing high production is not escapism Keep it valuable You made a commercial potentially Yeah like people think raw production I think value not value Making a video that looks great but it is just there for you to get a sale is less valuable to the other person on the other end You guys shooting the shit and actually talking about real shit clearly was more valuable Another thing we just did it was kind of a test but it felt like cheap attention and it was getting banner ads in the airport in the concourse Yeah We do not have a campaign strategy yet but if you were trying to target SMB business travelers in an airport is there like a call to action or I would do in that scenario which I like real life like media if it is under priced I like the idea of going literal Are you a small business Do you have a business problem Text us and put a phone number You collect the data I like that I would do that Okay You get first party data you can call them you can see it through you can see how it is working The direct response text Maybe you make a funny little asterisk and be like we will not save your information Maybe you show a picture of yourself like you know so you can play Let me bounce around we will come around again Sure I guess what I am trying to do is build community through I guess first responders and then my identity markers That is basically all I want to do And first responder help me just because I want to get educated Sure so like fire fighters ER nurses cops People that are first to accidents Understood And those people you want to get their attention to be their lawyer No to be the first person that everybody thinks of of the hottest people on the scene to respond to be a referral but then also the deepest relationship which you can have which is probably mirroring your identity markers of like I ID catholic Sicilian Irish If I could have complete penetration of those audiences I think that that would be disproportionately valuable as to going after other audiences Okay keep talking because I want to ground this Working backwards you have a law firm and we want to get people's businesses And so we first responders are incredible lead gen to that Yeah I mean I would say if they refer you they are going out to the scene they are helping people that have been in wrecks or in various different emergencies I understand Situations If they know and like you and trust you from the sense that you have been doing content Yep I totally agree So just as somebody who I guess thank god has not been in this scenario yet and just have not dug in some accident happens and the relatives that are left over that are not at the hospital may look at a cop or a first responder and say "Can you give me a lawyer right now" Yeah who can help us right That is cool I just have never Yeah hottest First to the customer right Yeah I totally understand Okay have you considered in parallel building the most macro brand in the general area as well with the end consumer That is what I am trying to do through the blog So I got a whole camera set up I took your long form content six highlights hour long trying to get to 52 weeks so I can have full penetration How long you been doing it I am on episode I have taped six released four And what are you feeling so far It is so early obviously You know it is funny I have always thought lawyers When I first started talking about this I am like fucking lawyers right because In a good way in a good way because I was thinking you know if you think like I always say what I am really good at is not knowing anything and asking questions Curiosity and lack of education has been an incredible foundation for me But you think about all that stuff on remnant Television where the lawyers are there right and I am like you know And then when I got older and like when I started like Just through like being in a business cocktail you hear like some of those companies are sizable businesses and I am like makes sense right And so when I started going to this version no different than they are like hey guys make something that is valuable to people instead of right I was like man I even think in my earliest videos when I was talking about personal brand I was like be the lawyer that tells people all the real shit Like I just feel like that is great That makes so much sense to me So now I understand that now so now what you are asking me is targeting capabilities that if you are in a town that all the cops are Irish America like how do I win that Yeah like building basically within that Cohorts The group's doing a party once a year with the cohorts and then I am going to do a boxing thing where I want to get all the lawyers in town have every lawyer come I am going to probably box in six months And then every like year I am going to have other people from different like factions within the lawyer community do amateur boxing Love it Where are you based Houston So okay So now that I have got the landscape a lot better what is the question Basically how do I build up communities that details 100 details that every one idea takes to execute How do I best go about becoming the alpha one each one of these communities In the phycho and demographic communities By providing each one of them what they are looking for either in the macro or the micro of what you do for a living So you know SMB works for me so much is like I am trying to tell them to put out content about how to fire a relative has nothing to do with their product but I know that is a huge value to actual SMBs I think the answer is the way I think about that is you take the how many different communities do you think there are Intuitively Well there is a ton I mean right But you have to narrow down to three or one or four that you can go really deep on And I think what you do is you whiteboard the ten that you think are the most meaningful Yeah I got that Then rank them And then really go deep in the first three of like really spending time Whether reading whether actually spending time But it is the strategy and insights to make what they like what makes them tick and then providing that Whether through content form or event form Its really one big game of reverse engineering Like this was something I have wanted to do for years But until I felt like everybody for the far majority would leave here ROI positive on their investment like the thought of like building up everything I have built up where like you two brothers do not do it and then leave and then say "Gary V's a farce "I spent 12000 bucks and it did not get me anything" That is just stupid business for me I needed to get to a place where I thought this was so overwhelmingly ROI positive you know And that is how I think about everything literally everything Sneakers wine Vayner Media Until you get to a place and so that is just what I want you to kind of do its like what does The only thing that I can do that I can think of is basically copying your model which I have done for the lawyer aspect and I can have all my friends come in and be the top lawyer guy in that community right But as I get more awareness in the first responder group I would love to have a show of the firefighter comes to the car wreck The ER is the first person in the hospital Having like a little drama with people throughout the community that you have I do not know if you want to I mean listen you are just a creative guy I can already sense that so you just may want to do that I actually think its a little less ER and Law and Order I think you make it a little bit more so I am a big fan I am sure you guys have heard this about like hosting the party I think one of the things you can do is just create a podcast network So like I think you should go find two charismatic nurses and start a Houston nursing show You are the executive producer they are the talent and that becomes a little viral hit in that community You see where I am going Ill give you a real left field one if you want to be super creative You could also this is crazy but I would love for you to do this I think this is super cool you could actually be the live streamer of the cop's and firefighter's softball league What if you acted like ESPN had six people with live streaming and actually aired the softball league games Yeah that would be great Yeah I mean if you are lucky enough and if you live in one of those towns where the cops do play against the firefighters Like or you could literally create the Thanksgiving game Cops versus firefighters Get a field get a high school to support it Film it and air it live on Facebook and own the you know the First Responders Cup You could probably get a sponsor to come over and subsidize all your fucking fees You could literally throw the fucking Thanksgiving game Every fucking Friday Like you see where I am going What I want to do I want to create basically the best I think its a lot easier to throw Than the community I think the best thing you can throw is a literal podcast its the most likely thing you can pull off is a podcast network The next more likely thing you can pull off is actually airing the softball games or the football games The last thing you are probably likely to pull off is creating ER You are not producing a show Okay That is hard as fuck Scripted It would be like interview based basically That is different That is different Tell me your experience of That is different that is different That is different That is different but less reoccuring Yeah it would be harder to go deep on that that is for sure And it would be one off Once you interview Karen Whereas You will have more people Whereas if you are doing a show for nurses in Houston and just the culture of that and its a call in you see where I am going You want to create things that are like scalable Wine library TV was amazing I tasted wine Which meant I could live 400 lifetimes and never get to every wine Right Ask Gary V Think about the shows I have made Wine library TV Scalable in perpetuity I cannot taste every wine in my life Not in a hundred lives Ask Gary V unlimited questions from the audience forever Daily vlog I actually live just film me There was never I never had to create See where I am going See Got it That is what you are looking for My man You know we were launching the home owner now and we think that if you are a consumer right now right home ownership rate is at 64 in America It is the most its been since the crash 64 of Americans own a home Adults correct 220 million people 64 it is the highest in a long time And by the way just so you know to clear When you made your comments about owning a home and investing I was all about that Because you are entrepreneurial Right Its all situational right 100 And I got where your coming from You are not saying do not ever own a home I mean its like you got a million dollars and you live in New York where you going to put it If I did a better job clarifying it You did That podcast the next week was Yeah I was glad I did that But even funny like what I really really realize is the thing I am most upset about or like want to bring upset's the wrong word The thing that I would wish people do I did it everybody does it The number one conversation is let us stop overextending ourselves with our down payment It is unbelievable Almost every single person when they buy a home think the home is such a great investment that they basically every dollar they have in liquid is their down payment Then they get a mortgage now they have no fucking savings and they are living for that mortgage Brother we live that every day That is what like my big thing now is like you know how like Oprah started the whole movement for like you know every woman in America go get checked up Go to the doctor on your birthday Like I am so proud of like that was such a smart thing She like found a very simple way for a lot of women during the 80s and 90s and early 2000s to remember to go to the doctor I want to create a rule of like whatever your net however much liquid you have half of that is what your allowed to put on a down payment on your home because that is 64's going to be 39 when the fucking thing collapses because everyone is so overextended they cannot support the mortgage when they lose their job You know there is a huge misconception in our industry that you need 20 down to fund a home and that is absolutely incorrect In fact we always promote generally as a trusted advisor that you should put down as little as possible assuming you can afford the payments right Because if you are renting you are paying 100 interest to a landlord Yes And that is what made everyone in Europe rich and there is no middle class So at least now in America its still affordable It is the number one way to generate wealth and so you do not have to have 20 Use your cash cash is king use it for other things Like invest in yourself But if you are going to live somewhere you are paying rent anyway If you are paying 1500 bucks a month or New York 4000 Talk to me about that perception because I am fascinated Most places you do not have to put 20 down No if you are a veteran its zero If you live in the outskirts you get an agriculture USD loan zero money down FHA loans three and a half percent down which you can get gifted from a friend And now there is even crowd source go fund me funds allowed as a kind of a pilot through Freddie Mac If you do a conventional loan it is 5 down Perception though comes from at 20 down you have an 80 loan to value you do not owe mortgage insurance in addition I see So everyone is trying to avoid the MI I totally understand But you are trying to avoid the MI by spending all your cash then you cannot invest yourself in everything else alive And so it is okay for your Cool So your first home it is okay you are first time home buyers at 32 okay the average age So to get into that house is where we want people to be because you start generating wealth for you your family generations to come So as a consumer Yeah but is not that an interesting like just for my own knowledge I think it is interesting to me Like generating wealth on something that you owe 80 to 95 now to pay off you are generating an asset in 20 years Right Sure It is an interesting fucking debate But see you actually when you say about cash is king and not being it down you are actually making the argument I understand I understand of course I understand Because you are already paying rent anyway I totally understand Because do not forget the asset appreciates over time average To your point to your point what I need to add layers to is actually the livelihood I am thinking about living it So like there is a big delta between what you are renting what you are buying It is all one big game the same thing which is to your point how one uses their cash Well I love how you talked about a young entrepreneur Like these guys are perfect examples Good job man you are out of Boston it is way warmer where you are at you get to see him once a month So this dude floats around but he is a little more anchored but you float around So I float around I have floated around my whole life I am 42 after I left Austin I had my first place I bought in Austin right So I bought my condo I still own in I rent it out Someone is paying for that on that asset Then I lived in Chicago I moved to Tampa I was living there for six months each moved to Fort Lauderdale I bought multiple properties in Fort Lauderdale I did not sell them and use the cash for my next thing because I saved cash All those properties are now rented out So someone else is paying for my retirement and my winter home if I ever get so lucky Now I am in Newport Beach and I bought an apartment there So when you have that lifestyle and you can float around Airbnb income is now a verifiable income source for you to purchase a home as an individual And so you touched on on one of your videos about maybe you do not want to be anchored down but now the industry is evolving as well those that do not want to anchor down like I have then you can just rent it out because there is always renters I mean there is always a renter I pay warehouse renter's warehouse I pay them 80 bucks a month they take care of it they send me a text comment needs to be done yep I will do it cool Yeah I totally get it And someone is paying for my wealth I love it Go ahead Okay so if you are a consumer and you are trying to find You are looking about 93 98 different places for information and you are trying to come up with buying a home online So those eyeballs are out there they are on YouTube they are on everything you have got So then when you want to actually engage as a "ready buyer" you know if you asked the first time home buyer like what do you think of when you think of mortgage right They will be like I do not know Rocket Mortgage So Rocket Mortgage is a call center in Detroit I am aware That is it So if I am smash hit for MiamiDade I ama talk to some little white dude on a headset in Detroit to get my loan that might not be Yeah but Dan Gilbert's ability to get somebody who can speak Spanish is not very hard Not to Of course they have them So that argument's not going to play No but the argument though is that local experts have local knowledge and only a local expert right So we want to bring this back down to the community level right So you know you are in your community we are all deeply rooted in our community A real estate agent or a loan originator has knowledge in their brain about their local community like that is a good neighborhood that is a bad neighborhood here is how you mange your debt okay I know where you work I know where you are going I got a hedge guy this is the bad school this is the good school All those things those knowledge bases right there they are not out there in the fintech world I understand They are built up over living in a community for 10 20 30 40 years What the fintech companies are going to do is win the top of the funnel and then address those things underneath That is right But that is right So there is a commoditization going on in our industry it is mostly driven by price Correct But the difference between And brand Correct Which is the guerrilla marketing part that I like about this This is my whole argument Like you are not going to beat technology the only thing that is going to allow anybody to survive as things get commoditized and driven down the internet will drive everything to the lowest dollar and you are not going to beat somebody who is much more well funded than you The only thing that plays is brand Agreed which is why we are here and all these fintech companies they are not coming here they are not Our business is filled with old stodgy bankers right So like I brand myself and my reputation as you put it on LinkedIn and so I put out videos of myself I am the only C level executive in our industry the only owner of a mortgage lender that is literally talking about like hey I went to this mortgage event last week and I saw Darren Hardy speak and he said this this and this And you know by the way when you are in a business meeting is not it funny how you know someone who is like grabbing their eye or scratching their nose and you know you are about to shake that person's hand Let us just be self aware of something like that So I do not want to go humor with that I cannot tell you I go everywhere I get all these just dude I love your videos I love your content it is hilarious Of course And so yes so brand that is me branding to our subscriber network You are talking about the end user I understand Yeah I need them to They are going to pay 495 a month to start we already have about 270 subscribers The game plan is to have 7500 real estate agents and 7500 loan originators within three years We think that is super doable We need to brand to the consumer That is this part this is what I am here for this is I want the consumer to know So if you are a consumer and you think mortgage you think Rocket Mortgage you might say Lending Tree because there is some branding out there or you just might say I do not know And so the mind share Which means then you go to Google and then it becomes a tollbooth game Your industry and many service providers for the last 15 years have been playing one big game of whoever was the layer above Google itself the next tier won OpenTable billion dollar company Priceline Angie's List HomeAdvisor This is all the same shit Google was the tollbooth everybody that was localized or was a big player before was emotional on why they are better than the internet Some people got funding one Google search and became the fucking winners And right now it is Quicken They bought all the ad words I am aware I am aware But I do not want to be a necessary like search I love all the other You cannot do search it is too expensive for you Search if I was Gary V in 2000 I built on search Everybody's like he won on social I won on search and email The reason I won bigger on social because I am like oh this is the same thing and this time I got smart I am like I am going to invest in this shit Right Then that is how I won Then the next tier was fuck it I am going to do it to myself I am going to become the top of the funnel because then I can fucking open wine or a sneaker or a fucking I can open a Vayner anything and be a player I can build a real real estate brokerage right now Vayner Realty help you build your personal brand that is the only thing that actually matters and I am going to take a smaller cut than REMAX I am a problem You are I am aware So that is why I am excited about this conversation So So the economics are going to play itself out This is not an economic play Brother you got this figured out It is only that And so I like where this conversation's going because I think you have got the groundwork now let me give you the answer Everything for you has to be building the brand in places that are under priced that you could afford So step number one giving you this verbatim You have to go hit up every single mortgage and real estate podcast that exists Email them I do not give a fuck if they have eight fuckin' listeners email them and offer them as little money as possible for them to live read your commercial at the top of the podcast And that goes for all of you Like small business shows lawyer show Like I do not give a fuck if they are in Denver like shit's funny how it actually trickles down So you need to win podcast preroll because I think it is grossly under priced because nobody knows what it costs So that is huge YouTube videos targeted against search queries from Google The place where Quicken and OpenTable and all those guys have not gotten to yet at the scale that makes it impossible for you is YouTube preroll based on search query on Google If you then can use your personality or whatever else you come up with whatever your Geico or MetLife is MetLife decided to use Snoopy Geico decided to every six months do something funny If you have that as a preroll You know Gary Vaynerchuk goes and looks for a home or whatever terms are important in your world but then goes watches a Jets video on YouTube but Google has both sides of that funnel and you are prerolling and you are like are you in the market for a home I am like I am Before I watch that Jets video that is another play that will absolutely work for you But most of all this is for all of you as well becoming the media company you become the tollbooth You become Google instead of being the second tier That is why I built Gary V Because this is all going to Alexa This is all going to I mean this is how it is going to work Hey Alexa I need a mortgage Amazon's the problem Trust me this is Hey Google I need a chiropractor That is how it is going to work And unless you are in the business of you know if it is like hey Alexa I need a social media agency Alexa's the problem Hey Alexa what is Vayner Media's phone number That is the difference That is all that is going to be left That is all that is going to be left Will it get to your industry Will it get there fast enough that you give a fuck financially But in the end that is the world Brand nothing else That is what it is That is what you have to do That is why content matters that is why building your personal brand matters building your company matters content content content Because that is your only leverage against highly funded multi trillion dollar funded global companies that are going to try to get everything Great So we are branding ourselves we are trying a couple different methods We are starting with YouTube videos like for example if you search you know the five things you should know about being a first time home buyer or six pitfalls to avoid when listing a home So we are putting out video content Our first wave I guess if you will of marketing and building these data funnels is that I am using Sabrina Brian who is our spokesperson from Cheetah Girls Just because she is free and she is part of our She is a friend of ours And she is got a wholesome brand right Sounds right to me Free and wholesome sounds great Right So if someone picks that video when they come in we know they are either looking to buy a home or looking to list a home and then we know we can filter them out of our website So the idea is to give a consumer like if you go to Lending Tree you go to Zillow you go to Rocket Mortgage just to talk to someone there just to talk to someone you have to enter all this information I understand So we are not doing any of that Smart We are freely giving away every single piece of information that I think that is right I think that is right I think that is right And then the consumer chooses okay well Could not agree more Here is everyone in my zip code or my city Brother whoever brings the most value to a customer wins And what the last generation was about was give me your data before anybody knew how much data was worth and I will give you free stuff and we were all pumped I mean some of you are too young but for real it was like whoa 2002 2001 20034 Like I will give my email and name but I get this for free instead of buying out of this magazine for nine bucks It was amazing Now we understand that data's valuable We are more reserved we are a little more thoughtful we will give it I still think we are giving it the privacy thing is grossly overrated We do not give a fuck We do not We are doing it every day The mainstream media's trying to make us scared every day we put all our fuckin' information every day We want convenience The reason I like yours is not so much that I am giving up the information I just do not want to give up the two minutes to fill out all the shit Time But they do at some point Of course when you transact you are giving information But the fact that you are putting it in the front it is what I do I give away all my best stuff for free in perpetuity with maybe some rationale eventually something might happen I am playing the ultimate game of it Right The bad version of me is I give a little and then it is really a funnel for you to pay me $4000 a month to be in my mastermind Right Or I will be scalable and sell you a $197 ebook on how to do this Those guys Those guys We struggle a little bit with whether to brand individually one of our cofounders or whether we should you know like Both The answer to all of you is both Okay cool Because Angie's List kind of has Angie at the front and then she has everyone else Both Okay cool That is okay It is not only okay it is a priority and my recommendation Some people like the person and some people do not thus you should do both Some people love the idea of like doing business with the person they see on the other side of the video some people like to think that it is an organization No friction for the end user that is my religion Well I do not want to dominate time I may think of some other things but I want to save You know I just got this Samsung S10 with 1 terabyte of internal memory by the way and it came with TikTok and you have been talking about TikTok And it is amazing the amount of views and eyeballs that are on that I mean incredible They just happen to be eight to 12 years old Well 18 to 24 there is a There is but not like Like NBA is on there like I follow it is the only one I follow Of course but 18 to 24's on Instagram Like TikTok is eight to 12 Well I am not seeing that maybe they do not show up in my feed but No no listen I mean I think that well do not confuse the content producer with the content consumer Okay got it Got it You are not seeing it because people are producing I mean I am producing TikTok because I want nine year olds to be Gary V fans now Lil V I am super in Well that is going fuckin' five Yeah Because a nine year old is doing business Like I genuinely think that there is a very substantial chance that one of my biggest investment payoffs will be somebody who is nine years old now and when she or he is building the next Facebook demands that I am an investor and that I will be able to talk on stage in 21 years that my two billion dollar exit on the Amazon of its day was predicated because I was making TikTok and Lil V content and that became the gateway drug to Sara wanting me to be an investor and that is how I got the deal We want that long game as well I do not understand how people do not I am 43 like In like 12 years I am going to be 55 Like I am going to be young Young People do not think long term So they think TikTok's a waste of time like cool I will take all those customers I am not selling any nine year old wine now Hopefully I will not sell a house either Exactly But we will at some point and we want that mind share We are trying to get mind share If nothing else you will see a trend in there that makes you a better creator on Instagram People do not see hidden value it is like this hidden cost People are too literal That is what they said about social media as a whole The reason nobody went into social media was that it was for kids That is what Facebook was Facebook literally was made fun of on a daily basis in real business because I was in real business for being for kids Now it is only for 60 to 80 year olds Thank you So you talk about brand I am confused about the right hook aspect of it Good So I am building brand building brand building brand and I provided solutions to people solutions they can buy what I am using but I do not have not We talked a lot about earlier this morning about advertising and taking advantage of the opportunity What is your take I mean how do you handle brand Real quick real quick One thing is it is working I think you might be thinking that I am going to give you a different perspective that I think you are going to enjoy I think you should amplify your jabs not your right hooks That is it So spend money on the jab Because the jab I do people buy the stuff and I do not even talk about it it is magical You are more Larry Holmes than you are Mike Tyson Me too Which I am cool with that Me too Larry Holmes held a title longer to Mike Tyson Second question Building a media team not knowing That first part really resonated with you right Yeah You got it I got it You are done you are set You properly thought about amplifying You know I am getting goosebumps Advertising comes synonymous with selling So you were like fuck okay I am going to spend money In general I do not like throwing right hooks because I am so good at jags right You are like fuck what am I going to do That is is not that fun I will get one out of 100000 comments that says You sold out Yeah Dude I still get mad about that I get it I get it I am the same way it is why I wrote the fuckin' book I literally thought about it so much from 2007 8 9 10 11 I finally got to What is ironic about jab to jab right hook was on paper it seemed like I was trying to help all the people who are always selling which I was It is like slow it down like a little romance you know Ironically it ended up helping more people that were all jabbing You and I are probably unique in the fact that our jabs back to Larry Holmes are so effective that we win There is a whole group of people who just give give give and they actually have to ask And they were scared to ask A lot of people are not natural sales people a lot of people are scared to make that move It was really funny to watch it play out I absolutely thought it was going to be all the those guys be like slow it down a little romance right like give value And it ended up being a bigger breakthrough for people that were giving value but not making any money because they did not know how to ask It is interesting Anyway you are going to kill by amplifying jabs Because you are clearly bringing value Brother the only reason you are selling so much stuff is because you are bringing so much value I get that So I want you to make more people see the thing that you are bringing value in Yeah I spend all my 80 of my ad money excuse me unless I am selling sneakers or wine just because I am learning Plus I have a unique life where I have to use myself to understand certain things that I have to use for the agency So I am even doing things that I do not necessarily want to be doing like selling wine and sneakers at some level because it helps us so much with Vayner Because my clients care about selling product But I spent almost all my ad money on the content that organically shows me it is doing best and brings the most value and then I spend my own money to help more people get value because I know it resonates with people And then when you have something to sell it turns That is right Do not advertise the store My big thing where I really made out and this is where it is a little bit different potentially for what I know about you is I do not need to sell a single thing as Gary V because I actually run Vayner Media I really fuckin' put myself in a good spot where I have zero need to monetize my audience So does my retail business is that a standalone business Yes That is where it can get real good Though I like what I am hearing in the relationship you have with your audience Seems like it is organic seems like you are selling things you believe in Listen nothing is more exciting than selling something you believe in The second you get paid a million dollars under the table to even sell the glue that is when you are fucked But if you are actually selling something you actually believe in you will fuckin' win My biggest problem with people is they sell something they do not believe in It is the thing that they have stumbled into it is the thing that they just think they will make the most money on That is the thing that makes them most vulnerable super long term If you fuckin' love it and you believe in it There is a lot of things I could be selling that would make me a lot more money you know I love when people when I do tra Like I do things that I want to be doing Like I love showing people that have 20 bucks how to like start living their life with more money That is why I do Trash Talk There is literally people that leave comments like Gary V this is not going to help you buy the Jets No shit dick I understand that eight hours of my time is not making $309 is not necessarily the mathematical equation to get to the Jets But is it Because if I help 40 million people live a much better life if I am $200 million short when the time comes can I crowd fund the last part I think so You got me to buy your wine just on your free advice I am completely convinced but when the time comes this whole country's going to demand that I own the Jets not want it I really believe that I really genuinely believe that Full penetration Full penetration Completely massive awareness I still would much prefer to be capable of doing it myself because I do not like to ask which is really a funny thing if like then I ask the whole world It is almost like back to who I am pulling from opposite directions So that is what I think Fascinating Building a media team Yes Doing it yourself or hiring a team Yes Oh I always think you should do it yourself because I always think like I am just a big fan of that in general You know we obviously aspire to be the best Like Vayner is one big attempt to do something I do not believe in Like I believe that everybody should do everything themselves You learn it is cheaper you figure it out And it is back to like almost like this fun world I live in and so what Vayner's entire Sasha for sure Vayner for sure is if you have to how do I create the greatest solution to something I do not believe in It is why it is working Took me a while to realize that is what I was doing Yeah I see it I see why I have three media people Hire young smart talented people and then make them better than they could ever be on their own But you make a lot of mistakes along the way You do you do and I think that is why we built Vayner Talent We are starting to understand it We are starting to think about it differently We have a new product we are going to roll out on the Gallery Media side to help people start their podcasts There is stuff I am figuring out I think of myself as like the Incredible Hulk right Like I was a scientist I had this thesis and I do not remember exactly was it by accident but like to me I am like I am taking my own Like the way I decided to prove to the whole world that I was super right about how to brand was to make myself the most famous fuckin' person in America From a place where did not think you could build that kind of level of fame And that is kind of like the process I am in I think one day that whole trajectory of like first you do marketing for your own business then you do it for others then you do it back for yourself like I almost think like they will be a model named after me because I think there is a lot of people that will do it like me Let me give you an insight that might help you with this next chapter where you are building out the agency Do not be scared for people to leave once you build them up Most people walk that fine line like if you build up Carol or the shop well then Gary can hire them for Sasha And that is where people lose You need to create a system that everybody wants to go into That is how I think about it The reason I am willing to like build up DRock and I am happy that Babin got the Adobe thing and like you know Claude and James Like the reason I do that is because first of all you have to be confident that you are bigger than all of it to If anybody's better than you you already got a problem Second humans are animals they will sense if you are suppressing it And because karma's good Like if you helped Carol get put on and she gets a $60000 raise and gets to move back to San Francisco where her family is that is just putting good into the world You do not pay her the 60 I mean look I have been more than happy to not want to lose a good executive but I do not pay ransom for sure Anybody that even If they are the number one all time person and they come in with ransom vibes it is already over I have always laughed about that when somebody comes in and goes "Gary I have got to talk to you" You know I am like you are f Like it is already Like they could be the single most important person they are already gone because I am not That is just going to make me unhappy That makes me feel like a fuckin' loser So that is number one Number two if they come in and say "Hey" I love when they come in and try to make me part of the process I will overpay if you come at me correctly Hey I love it here you have been such a mentor I have got this crazy opportunity it is hard I have got college loans Like I have sometimes thought somebody was a C and paid up because I liked they way they came at me And then sometimes you let them walk because you cannot afford it the delta You know they are overrated by their association with the best So there is a lot of people who think they are a lot better than they are because they are associated with me And sometimes you cannot close that delta And you are happy for them That was not like a Yeah it was a little bit of a razz but it is far more of a I am happy I am like uh Like you are going to a competitor and making fuckin' 55 more because you are wearing a Vayner jersey and they need that DNA in the building You are welcome I am happy I am happy Listen good is good There are people who have literally on the way out of here because we fired them but I let them control their communications have told people that they are quitting have said that I am the biggest piece of shit of all time and I am completely full of shit burned everything around them in their last week before they left and three years later are referring business to us Because if you are right if you are in a good place you are in a good place Of course people are going to go to Glassdoor and tell everybody Vayner Media sucks or to their best friend that Vayner Media sucks when they get fired People do not like getting fired Who likes getting fired Nobody thinks you are right But over time they get context and as long as I am kind and my intent is right and I am trying to do the right things that plays out And I am okay with being judged definitely by the outside you know that comment right But even willing to be judged with people that should know better because they are right here because they are in pain at the time
